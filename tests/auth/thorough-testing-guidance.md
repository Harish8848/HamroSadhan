# Thorough Testing Guidance for Login and Signup Features

This document provides guidance and example scripts for thorough testing of the login and signup features, covering UI/UX edge cases, email confirmation flow, API endpoint edge cases, forgot-password and confirm-email pages, and end-to-end testing.

---

## 1. UI/UX Edge Cases and Input Validation

- Test input validation beyond required fields, e.g.:
  - Invalid email formats
  - Password strength requirements
  - Phone number format validation
  - Handling of empty optional fields
- Test UI behavior on slow network or server errors
- Test accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

### Example Script (React Testing Library)

```tsx
// Add tests for invalid email, weak password, etc.
```

---

## 2. Email Confirmation Flow

- Test that after signup, the user receives a confirmation email with a valid token link
- Test that clicking the confirmation link updates user role from "pending" to "confirmed"
- Test expired or invalid tokens handling

### Example Approach

- Use integration tests or API tests to simulate token generation and confirmation
- Use curl or Postman to test confirmation endpoint with valid/invalid tokens

---

## 3. API Endpoint Edge Cases

- Test all auth-related endpoints with:
  - Missing required fields
  - Invalid data formats
  - Duplicate registrations
  - Unauthorized access attempts
- Use curl or automated API testing tools (e.g., Postman, Insomnia, or Jest with supertest)

### Example curl command

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signup -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"pass"}'
```

---

## 4. Forgot-Password and Confirm-Email Pages

- Test rendering and form validation of forgot-password and confirm-email pages
- Test API endpoints for password reset requests and email confirmation
- Test error handling and success messages

---

## 5. End-to-End Testing

- Use tools like Cypress or Playwright to automate full user flows:
  - Signup → Email confirmation → Login → Access dashboard
  - Forgot password flow
- Verify UI updates, API responses, and side effects (e.g., token storage)

---

## Next Steps

- Implement automated tests based on above guidance
- Perform manual exploratory testing for UI/UX and edge cases
- Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline for continuous verification
